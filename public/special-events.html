        <h1>SPECIAL EVENTS</h1>
        <p>
          We would love to host your next event at Munchies! All parties of 15
          or more guests are considered special events, requiring a
          pre-selected, family style, menu as well as a Food and Beverage
          Minimum.<br /><br />

          The Food and Beverage Minimum is the minimum that a party would need
          to meet, with food and beverages during the course of their events, in
          the restaurant, in order to reserve the space. <br /><br />

          All events are booked for a duration of three hours. We also offer
          full restaurant buyout options, upon request.<br /><br />

          For additional information, or to book your next event with Munchies,
          please see below for further information!
