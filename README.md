# Project Description

Our website is a *fully responsive* platform serving as a conventional digital marketing source, as well a method for users to cater online, for a fictional restaurant, named ***Munchies***, located in downtown Philadelphia. 

# Expected Use

The user can explore the different pages of the site to learn more information regarding special events, menu items, and making reservations. 

The user has an option to order food online while dining in using the Menu page or order large quantities for bigger events on the Catering page. The Cart page will update quantities and items in real time as the user selects which ever they choose. If an item is out of stock, the user will be notified.

Additionally, managers have special access that enables admins to change database items, such as menu prices or restaurant hours. 

## Project Construction

### MVPs

- Clean UI/UX

- Have the mysql database communicate with the application regarding stock quanities

### New Technology

We've implemented a few technologies and techniques in our project, including

- Manager admin access
- Flex-box for responsive design

### Features for the Future
With any business, as the marketing strategy evolves, so does the digital presence. Some improvements may include:

* Brand loyalty programs using a point / reward system 
* Allowing users to put additional instructions for specific food orders
* Restaurant rating/review section
* Community events
* Displaying social media activity on the main page

### Project Review

We think we have acheived the goals we set out when initially coming up with this project idea. We have built a strong foundation on which this project can grow and a framework that can easily expand to a product that can be utilized for real-life clients.
